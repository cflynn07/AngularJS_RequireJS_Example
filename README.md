AngularJS_RequireJS_Example
===========================

An example of how to best use AngularJS and RequireJS together.

Preface
-------

AngularJS and RequireJS can and should always be used together. They are both useful tools that solve
different, mutually exclusive problems with client-side web application development. AngularJS has a
concept of 'modules' and this may confuse someone who is new to either Angular or Requre.  

### In a Nutshell:
*RequireJS is for organizing JavaScript into clean files/modules and making sure they load
in the order in which they depend on each other, and AngularJS doesn't concern itself with this problem*
